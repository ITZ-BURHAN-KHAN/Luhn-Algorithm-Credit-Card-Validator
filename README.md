# Luhn Algorithm Credit Card Validator

A simple Python implementation of the Luhn Algorithm for validating credit card numbers, completed as part of a FreeCodeCamp project.

The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers. This project implements the Luhn Algorithm in Python, allowing users to validate credit card numbers easily.

## Project Overview

By building this project, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation. The program reads a credit card number, processes it according to the Luhn Algorithm, and determines whether it is valid or invalid.

## Features

- Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm
- Handles card numbers formatted with spaces or dashes
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main()` function to test the credit card validation with the provided card number.
3. Modify the `card_number` variable in the `main()` function to test other credit card numbers.

## Example Usage

```python
def main():
    card_number = '4111-1111-4555-1142'  # Example valid card number
    # Your code here
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
